# Invalid Tags Check

This check flags features based on configurable filters.   

Each filter has 2 parts. The first is a list of AtlasEntity classes (node, edge, area, etc.). The second is a 
[TaggableFilter](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas/blob/dev/src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/tags/filters/TaggableFilter.java). 
If a feature is one of the classes given and passes the TaggableFilter then it is flagged.

**Filter Example:**

Areas and Relations with the tag `boundary=protected_area` should have a `protect_class` tag.  
A filter to flag this would look like the following:  
`["area,relation","boundary->protected_area&protect_class->!"]`  
The first string is a list of the 2 AtlasEntity classes we want to look for. 
The second string is the taggable filter that is looking for the combination of `boundary=protected_area`
without a `protect_class` tag.

This would flag an osm feature like the following: [Way 673787307](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/673787307).

#### Code Review

In [Atlas](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas), OSM elements are represented as Edges, Points, Lines, Nodes, Areas & Relations; in our case, weâ€™re are looking at
[Edges](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas/blob/dev/src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/geography/atlas/items/Edge.java),
[Lines](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas/blob/dev/src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/geography/atlas/items/Line.java),
[Nodes](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas/blob/dev/src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/geography/atlas/items/Node.java),
[Points](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas/blob/dev/src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/geography/atlas/items/Point.java),
[Areas](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas/blob/dev/src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/geography/atlas/items/Area.java), and
[Relations](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas/blob/dev/src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/geography/atlas/items/Relation.java).

Due to the general nature of this check, most features are valid for this check.
The only validation requirement is that a feature of the same type and OSM ID has not been flagged before. 
Many other checks only look at the OSM ID when checking if a feature is flagged. Because this check deals 
with multiple types of features, and ids are not unique across types, this check has to check the type and id.

Once a feature has passed validation it is checks against the configurable filters. 
For each filter the feature is checked that it is of a type given in the first part of the filter
and passes the TaggableFilter. If both these things are true then the feature is flagged. 

For each filter a feature passes an instruction is added to the flag. The tag keys from the TaggableFilter 
are pulled out and added to the instruction to give guidance on where the problem is.
