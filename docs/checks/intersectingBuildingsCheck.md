# IntersectingBuildingsCheck

#### Description

The purpose of this check is to identify buildings that intersect other buildings.

#### Live Examples

1. Line [id:172116389](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/172116389) and [id:172116424](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/172116424) have _building=YES_ Tags and do not fully contain one another, so they are flagged as 'intersect'.
2. Line [id:525062338](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/525062338) fully contains [id:525062342](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/525062342) and both have _building=YES_ Tags.
3. Line [id:334111739](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/334111739) with _building=COMMERCIAL_ Tag fully contains [id:463063324](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/463063324) with _building=RESIDENTIAL_ Tag.

#### Code Review

Each pair of intersecting buildings will only be flagged once (i.e. A intersecting B = B intersecting A).

 An Atlas object must meet the following criteria to be considered a building:

- It must have at least 3 points.
- It must have a _building_ Tag and has a value that is defined in [BuildingTag.java](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas/blob/dev/src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/tags/BuildingTag.java).

Intersecting buildings are either flagged as 'intersect' or 'overlap':

- `intersectLowerLimit` and `overlapLowerLimit` are two configurable parameters that determine the flag type.
- The default values are: `intersectLowerLimit = 0.01` (1%), and `overlapLowerLimit = 0.90` (90%).
- Flag types:
    1. Intersect flag:
        - `intersectLowerLimit` <= the proportion of the intersection area compared to the smaller building area < `overlapLowerLimit`
        - Output instruction = 'building A intersects with building B'
    2. Overlap flag:
        - The proportion of the intersection area compared to the smaller building area >= `overlapLowerLimit`
        - Output instruction = 'building A is overlapped by another building B'
