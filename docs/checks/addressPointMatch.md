# Address Point Match Check

#### Description
This check identifies Point objects in OSM that have a specified street number (addr:housenumber) 
but no specified street name (addr:street). No specified street name refers to either having a null
value for the street name key, or no street name key present at all.

#### Live Example
The following examples illustrate two cases where a Point has a street number but no street name
in its tags.
1) This Point [id:977597085](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/977597085) has a street number but 
no street name specified in the address.
2) This Point [id:4552330391](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4552330391) has a street number but
no street name specified in the address.

#### Code Review
In [Atlas](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas), OSM elements are represented as Edges, Points, Lines, 
Nodes & Relations; in our case, weâ€™re are looking at [Points](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas/blob/dev/src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/geography/atlas/items/Point.java)
with specified street numbers but no street name.

Our first goal is to validate the incoming Atlas object. Valid features for this check will satisfy
the following conditions:
* Must be a valid Point object
* Must have a street number tag not equal to null
* Must have a street name tag equal to null OR not have the street name key present at all

```java
 @Override
    public boolean validCheckForObject(final AtlasObject object)
    {
        // Object is an instance of Point
        return object instanceof Point
                // And has a street number specified
                && object.getTag(ADDRESS_STREET_NUMBER_KEY).isPresent()
                // And if the street name key has a value of null
                && (!object.getTag(POINT_STREET_NAME_KEY).isPresent()
                    // Or if the street name key is not present
                    || !object.getTags().containsKey(POINT_STREET_NAME_KEY));
    }
```

After the preliminary filtering of features, we need to find candidates for populating each feature's
missing street name. We do this by drawing a bounding box, leveraging the [`boxAround()`](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas/blob/dev/src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/geography/Location.java), 
around the Point of interest using a configurable bounds size parameter. This value is set to a 
default of 150 meters. Using these bounds, we can consider other Points that fall inside the bounds 
that have a specified street number and street name using [`pointsWithin()`](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas/blob/dev/src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/geography/atlas/Atlas.java).
If there are no other Points found within this bounding box, we next look at edges within or which 
intersect with our bounding box using [`edgesIntersecting()`](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas/blob/dev/src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/geography/atlas/Atlas.java).
If there are no Points or Edges within or intersecting our bounds, we still flag the problematic
Point feature but with a specific instruction message indicating that no candidate street names were found.
Otherwise, we flag the Point and list a Set of unique candidate street names in the instructions.

```java
 @Override
    protected Optional<CheckFlag> flag(final AtlasObject object)
    {
        final Point point = (Point) object;
        // Get a bounding box around the Point of interest
        final Rectangle box = point.getLocation().boxAround(boundsSize);

        // Get all Points inside the bounding box
        Iterable<Point> interiorPoints = point.getAtlas().pointsWithin(box);
        // Convert the Iterable into a Stream for filtering
        Stream<Point> pointStream = StreamSupport.stream(interiorPoints.spliterator(), false);
        // Remove Points that have null as their street name as they cannot be candidates for
        // a street for the Point of interest
        Set<Point> points = pointStream.filter(interiorPoint -> interiorPoint.getTag(POINT_STREET_NAME_KEY).isPresent())
                .collect(Collectors.toSet());

        // Get all Edges that intersect or are contained within the bounding box
        Iterable<Edge> interiorEdges = point.getAtlas().edgesIntersecting(box);
        // Convert the Iterable into a Stream for filtering
        Stream<Edge> edgeStream = StreamSupport.stream(interiorEdges.spliterator(), false);
        // Remove Edge that have null as their street name as they cannot be candidates for
        // a street for the Point of interest
        Set<Edge> edges = edgeStream.filter(interiorEdge -> interiorEdge.getTag(EDGE_STREET_NAME_KEY).isPresent())
                .collect(Collectors.toSet());

        Set<String> streetNameList = new HashSet<>();

        // If there are no Points or Edges in the bounding box
        if (points.isEmpty() && edges.isEmpty())
        {
            // Flag Point with instruction indicating that there are are no suggestions
            return Optional.of(this.createFlag(point,
                    this.getLocalizedInstruction(1, point.getOsmIdentifier())));
        }
        // If there are Points in the bounding box
        else if (!points.isEmpty())
        {
            // Add all interior Point street names to the list of candidate street names
            points.forEach(interiorPoint -> streetNameList
                    .add(interiorPoint.getTags().get(POINT_STREET_NAME_KEY)));

        }
        // If there are Edges intersecting or contained by the bounding box
        else
        {
            // Add all interior Edge street names to the list of candidate street names
            edges.forEach(interiorEdge -> streetNameList
                    .add(interiorEdge.getTags().get(EDGE_STREET_NAME_KEY)));
        }

        return Optional.of(this.createFlag(point,
                this.getLocalizedInstruction(0, point.getOsmIdentifier(), streetNameList)));
    }
```
