# One Member Relation Check

#### Description

This check identifies relations that only contain one member. In OSM, a [Relation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Elements#Relation)
is a multi-purpose data structure that documents a relationship between two or more data elements 
(nodes, ways, and/or other relations).

#### Live Example
The following examples illustrate two cases where a Relation contains only one member.
1) This relation [id:4646212](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/4646212) has only one member.
2) This relation [id:7691824](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/7691824) has only one member.

#### Code Review

In [Atlas](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas), OSM elements are represented as Edges, Points, Lines, 
Nodes & Relations; in our case, weâ€™re working with [Relations](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas/blob/dev/src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/geography/atlas/items/Relation.java).

Our first goal is to validate the incoming Atlas Object. We use some preliminary filtering to target
Relation objects. Therefore, we use:
* Must be a Relation
* Must not have been flagged before

```java
    @Override
        public boolean validCheckForObject(final AtlasObject object)
        {
            return object instanceof Relation && !this.isFlagged(object);
        }
```

After the preliminary filtering of features, we get the members of that relation. If the number of
members in the relation is 1, and the relation is either not a Multipolygon relation or the sole 
member is role:inner, then we flag the relation as problematic.

```java
      @Override
         protected Optional<CheckFlag> flag(final AtlasObject object)
         {
             final Relation relation = (Relation) object;
             final RelationMemberList members = relation.members();
             
             if (members.size() == 1 && (!relation.isMultiPolygon()
                     || members.iterator().next()
                             .getRole().equalsIgnoreCase(RelationTypeTag.MULTIPOLYGON_ROLE_INNER))) {
     
                 this.markAsFlagged(relation);
                 return Optional.of(createFlag(
                         relation.members().stream().map(RelationMember::getEntity)
                                 .collect(Collectors.toSet()),
                         this.getLocalizedInstruction(0, relation.getOsmIdentifier())));
             }
             return Optional.empty();
         }
```
