# TollValidationCheck

#### Description
The purpose of this check is to identify ways that need to have their toll tags investigated/added/removed.

#### Configurables
- ***minimumHighwayType***: minimum highway type to include in this check. Tolls mainly reside on highways.
- ***maxAngleDiffForContiguousWays***: maximum angle difference between edges to be considered contiguous ways. This is important since most of the toll related investigation is on highways with small angle turns.
- ***minInAndOutEdges***: minimum count of Main in AND out edges from given way. This is important because there is logic that relies on an edge that does have at least one edge on the downstream and upstream side.
- ***maxIterationForNearbySearch***: maximum amount of iterations to complete while searching for nearby toll features.

#### Live Examples
Way Intersects Toll Feature - Missing toll tag
1. The way [id:824285021](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/824285021) intersects a toll feature and needs a toll=yes tag.

Inconsistent Toll Tags - way sandwiched between 2 toll=yes ways but does not have a toll tag
1. The way [id:498038529](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/498038529) is inconsistent with its surrounding toll tags.

Escapable Toll - Way has routes that escape toll feature so toll should be investigated for removal
1. The way [id:2039409](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/546540482) is deemed "escapable" since on either side of it there are ways with toll=no or no toll tag at all before
intersecting a toll feature. There needs to be an investigation as to if the way in question or the surrounding ways have been modeled properly.

#### Code Review
This check evaluates [Edges](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas/blob/dev/src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/geography/atlas/items/Edge.java)
, it attempts to find large jumps in highway classifications.

##### Validating the Object
We first validate that the incoming object is: 
* An Edge
* A Main edge
* The Edge is Car Navigable
* The Edge is of a specified minimum highway type (tertiary)
* is not private access

##### Flagging the Edge
##### Three scenarios of TollValidationCheck
###### Scenario 1
* Way intersects toll feature but does not have a toll tag.
###### Scenario 2
* Way has inconsistent toll tagging compared to surrounding ways.
###### Scenario 3
* Toll is escapable so the edge in question should not have toll tag since a toll is not required to drive on the road.

##### AutoFix Suggestion
* AutoFix Suggestion only applied to Way intersecting toll feature, Scenario 1 and inconsistent toll tags, Scenario 2.
