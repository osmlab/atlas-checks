Count the number of flags per check per country for a set of atlas-checks log files.
The input folder should contain subdirectories with country names or ISO codes that then contain log files.
The log files can be either gzipped or uncompressed.
There are 3 output types.
The 'run_summary' output is a table of the counts per check per country, including totals.
The 'check_summary' output is total counts per check.
The 'check_by_country' output is counts per country and check as rows.
A second directory of log files can also be input. This will produce an output of
the difference between the first and second input.
